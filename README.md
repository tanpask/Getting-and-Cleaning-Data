README.md The README file for this repo.

run_analysis.R does the following:

Step 1: "Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set."

Step 2: "Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement."

Step 3: "Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set."

Step 4: "Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names."

Step 5: "Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject."
